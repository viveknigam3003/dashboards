# Rocketium Analytics Dashboard

Rocketium built an in-house creative analytics engine which provides insights into the performance and characteristics of your ad creatives through Dashboards with interractive widgets.

Today's problem statement is around building a similar experience end-to-end using some sample data.
This problem is primarily a frontend problem, where you will have to design the data structure to store and display dashboards and widgets and build a UI to display the same.

We will strictly be using React and Typescript for this project.

## High Level Design
A creative analytics tool has 3 main components:

1. Dashboards
2. Widgets
3. Data

We will be defining a high level structure of our application model and then later build out a simple version of it.

More information will be shared by the interviewer.

Happy hacking!
