# Analytics Dashboard

Our company has an built an in-house creative analytics engine which provides insights into the performance and characteristics of your ad creatives through Dashboards with interractive widgets.

This problem statement is around building a similar experience end-to-end using some sample data. It is primarily a frontend problem, where you will have to design the data structure to store and display dashboards and widgets and build a UI to display the same.

We will strictly be using React and Typescript for this project.

## High Level Design
A creative analytics tool has 2 main components:

1. Dashboards
2. Widgets

We will be defining a high level structure of our application model and then later build out a simple version of it.
